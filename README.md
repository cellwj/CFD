# Marker Genes Reveal Dynamic Features of Cell Evolving Processes

This repository contains the analysis code and data related to the study titled "Marker genes reveal dynamic features of cell evolving processes." The study reveals the dynamic characteristics of cell evolution from three distinct perspectives: gene expression (microscopic), gene-gene interactions (mesoscopic), and cell processes (macroscopic).
